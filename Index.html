<p> Dear God, as I attempt to create this tribute page in honour of your memory, I realize that you are not a memory but in actual fact still a reality. I ask you to please lead me and guide me through this adventure as I attempt to understand, but also explain your life on earth and the meaning thereof. Please help me to understand your scripture and interpret it correctly. Lord I ask you to please prepare my heart and mind, but also the hearts and minds of every person reading this to accept your message into our hearts and apply it in our lives. Lord please help me to take much care and diligence in presenting this piece. Please lead me by the spirit because my mind can not fully understand or grasp your scripture by itself. In Jesus name I pray, amen.</P>

<p> As can be derived from the title of the tribute page. The "person" my tribute page will be about is <b>Jesus Christ</b>.</p>

<p> For so many Christians <b>Jesus</b> is the core of the bible. <b>Jesus</b> have been described as the <b>Son of God</b>, the Saviour of the world, the Messiah. But who was He really, what was His life like, what were the vents preceding His death and waht does that mean for the human race? I will attempt to answer some of these questions and identify some of the "main" events in the life of <b>Jesus</b> as depicted in the scriptures.</p>
<p> 
  <ul>
    <p> <li>The birth of Jesus prophesied</li>
    In the old testament we can see that the birth of Jesus was foretold long before His actual birth. <em>"therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign; behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call His name Immannuel." <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+7%3A14&version=KJV"> Isaiah 7:14 </a></em></p>
  <p>  <li>Mary visited by an angel</li>
    Now Mary, who was the mother of Jesus, was visited by an angel with the name of Gabriel. Gabriel said to Mary that she would conceive a son, as can be seen in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+1%3A31&version=KJV"> Luke 1:31 </a> <em>"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call His name <b>Jesus</b>." </em> </p>
  <p>  <li>Mary found to be with child</li>
    Mary was betrothed (similar to being engaged) to Joseph. According to Jewish custom the couple my not have been intimate as of yet, but Mary was found to be pregnant. This can be seen in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+1%3A18&version=KJV"> Matthew 1:18</a></p>
  <p>  <li>An angel appears to Joseph in a dream</li>
    According to Jewish civil law, Joseph was in his full right to divorce from Mary, because of her apparent "unfaithfulness." While Joseph was thinking about all these things an angel of the <b>Lord</b> appeared to him in a dream convincing him to marry Mary because what have happened to her is of the <b>Holy Spirit</b>. The baby was going to be a boy and were to be named <b>"Jesus",</b> which means "the Lord saves." <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+1%3A21&version=KJV"> Matthew 1:21</a></p>

  <p>  <li>Joseph escapes to Egypt with Mary and Jesus</li>
    Herod who was King of Israel heard that the King of the Jews were born and sought to kill Him because he didnt want the Jews to unite around a religious figure. An angel of the <b>Lord</b> appeared to Joseph in a dream to warn him of Herod and told him to take Mary and <b>Jesus</b> and to go to Egypt. <a href= "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+2%3A13-15&version=KJV"> Matthew 2:13-15 </a></p>

  <p>  <li>Jesus pray in Gethsemane</li>
    <b>Jesus</b> was sorrowful when He thought of the events that was about to take place. Not only was <b>Jesus</b> going to experience physical pain, but He who have always been in perfect union with <b>God</b> will experience for the first time separation from Him. In <b>Jesus'</b> "humanity" He struggled to face the task which He was faced with and pleaded with His Father to let it pass Him. Although <b>Jesus</b> struggled with the task He did not want His will to be done, but the will of the Father. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+26%3A36-45&version=KJV"> Matthew 26:36-45 </a></p>

    Darkness filled the land for about 3 hours from 6 to 9 and when it was the 9th hour, <b>Jesus</b> cried with a loud voice "My <b>God</b>, my <b>God</b>, why hast thou forsaken me?" <b>Jesus</b> cried the same just before He died. When <b>Jesus</b> died the veil of the temple tore in half and bodies started raising from the dead. A centurion and some of the people that was with him started to believe that <b>Jesus</b> was the Son of <b>God</b> after seeing all these things. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+27%3A+45-54&version=KJV"> Matthew 24:45-54 </a></p>

  <p>  <li>Jesus resurrected</li>
    After the sabbath Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb where <b>Jesus</b> was buried. There was an earthquake as one of the <b>Lord's</b> angels came down from heaven to go to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it. The angel told the two Mary's that <b>Jesus</b> was not in the grave anymore but that He has risen. He instructed them to go and tell the disciples of what has happened. The women left to tell the disciples all they have seen and heard and while on the road to go tell the disciples suddenly <b>Jesus</b> appeared to them, they fell to their knees and started to worship Him and He instructed them to tell the disciples to meet Him in Galilee. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A1-10&version=KJV"> Matthew 28:1-10 </a></p>
 <p>   <li>On the road to Emmaus</li>

    When they have arrived at the village, they convinced <b>Jesus</b> to stay with them as it was almost evening. While they were preparing to eat, <b>Jesus</b> gave thanks.

    As they were still telling the rest of the disciples about what happened, <b>Jesus</b> appeared to them, standing in their midst. The disciples were frightened and filled with fear, because they thought it was a ghost, but <b>Jesus</b> showed them His hands and feet so that they can see that it is really Him. <b>Jesus</b> told them that repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached all over the world and that they will receive power from heaven. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+24%3A36-49&version=KJV"> Luke 24:36-49 </a></p>
  <p>  <li>The ascension</li>
    <b>Jesus</b> led the disciples out to an area near Bethany, lifted up His hands and blessed them. While blessing them He dissapeared and was taken up into heaven. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+24%3A50-51&version=KJV"> Luke 24:50-51 </a></p>
  </ul>

    <h4><em>In conclusion:</em></h4> <section>Now why did <b>Jesus</b> have to die?
  Well, because all humans are sinners as can be seen in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+3%3A23&version=KJV"> Romans 3:23 </a> and our due penalty for sin is death. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6%3A23&version=KJV"> Romans 6:23 </a>
    Now if <b>God</b> loves us why does He want us to go to hell? Well, the answer to that is He doesn't. <b>God</b> is a fair and just <b>God</b>, even though He loves us He can't let us escape the justice we deserve. Almost like a fair and just judge who needs to deliver a verdict on a case.
    So what can we do? Thats just it, it have been done a long time ago when <b>God</b> sent His only Son <b>Jesus</b> to die for our sins. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+3%3A16&version=KJV"> John 3:16 </a>
      The only way we can escape the penalty of death is to believe in Jesus.</section>
